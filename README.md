# Game Studio

This course offers students a hands-on experience in game development, guiding them through the entire process of creating a game from concept to final prototype. Working in interdisciplinary teams, students will collaborate to design, develop, and polish a game project over the course of the semester. The course covers key areas such as project management, game design, programming, art, and testing, with regular team meetings and specialized workshops.

Students will gain practical skills in using game engines, problem-solving, and team collaboration, while also learning how to manage the challenges of game development in a structured, project-based environment.
